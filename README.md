Weekly Java programs covering basic to intermediate concepts — part of my learning journey at TestLeaf.

# ☕ Java Weekly Practice Programs

Welcome to my **Java Practice Repository**!  
This repo contains all my **weekly Java programs**, neatly organized by folders such as `week1`, `week2`, etc.  
Each week covers fundamental to intermediate Java concepts — from data types to loops, arrays, and real-time exercises.
